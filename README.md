This project uses GitHub Actions for quality and security validation.
Final test for actions

# FoxGresEA

FoxGresEA is a project built with a focus on clean structure, security, and code integrity.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for fully automated quality control and security validation.

✅ **Security Scan** – Detects and blocks forbidden files (e.g., .env, .pfx, .key) to prevent sensitive data leaks.  
✅ **Code Integrity Check** – Validates that all required project directories exist (`src`, `docs`, `images`, `tests`).  
✅ **Repository Validator** – Ensures the repository structure remains clean and consistent after every push.

Workflows are triggered automatically on every push to the `master` branch.

## Folder Structure


## Status

✅ All GitHub Actions workflows are operational and passing.  
✅ Codebase is monitored continuously for structural and security integrity.  
✅ Ready for development and future expansion.
