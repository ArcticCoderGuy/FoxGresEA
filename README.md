# FoxGresEA

FoxGresEA is a project built with a focus on clean structure, security, and code integrity.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for fully automated quality control and security validation.

âœ… **Security Scan** â€“ Detects and blocks forbidden files (e.g., .env, .pfx, .key) to prevent sensitive data leaks.  
âœ… **Code Integrity Check** â€“ Validates that all required project directories exist (`src`, `docs`, `images`, `tests`).  
âœ… **Repository Validator** â€“ Ensures the repository structure remains clean and consistent after every push.

Workflows are triggered automatically on every push to the `master` branch.

## Folder Structure


## Status

âœ… All GitHub Actions workflows are operational and passing.  
âœ… Codebase is monitored continuously for structural and security integrity.  
âœ… Ready for development and future expansion.
